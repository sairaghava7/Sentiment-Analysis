    "The days when one would get data in tabulated spreadsheets are truly behind us. A moment of silence for the data residing in the spreadsheet pockets. Today, more than 80% of the data is unstructured – it is either present in data silos or scattered around the digital archives. Data is being produced as we speak – from every conversation we make in the social media to every content generated from news sources. In order to produce any meaningful actionable insight from data, it is important to know how to work with it in its unstructured form.\n",

    "One of the first steps in working with text data is to pre-process it. It is an essential step before the data is ready for analysis. Majority of available text data is highly unstructured and noisy in nature – to achieve better insights or to build better algorithms, it is necessary to play with clean data and especially social media data is highly unstructured – it is an informal communication – typos, sarcasm, usage of slang, presence of unwanted content like URLs, Stopwords, Expressions etc. are the usual suspects. I'm coming up with the below 10 steps to clean the reviews which could be made ready for the analysis. Pls remember that these are not limited and we could come up with more steps to pre-process/clean the data. "
